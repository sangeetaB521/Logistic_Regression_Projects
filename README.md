# üìä Logistic Regression Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of machine learning projects that apply **Logistic Regression** for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. All notebooks use Python and libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

Each project demonstrates a complete ML workflow: data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
