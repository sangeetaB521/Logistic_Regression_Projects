# üìä Logistic Regression

This repository contains machine learning models using **Logistic Regression** for binary and multi-class classification problems. Implemented using Python's `scikit-learn` and `pandas`, these notebooks demonstrate end-to-end pipelines from data preprocessing to evaluation.
